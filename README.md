# react-prismazoom

## About

A pan and zoom component for React, using CSS transformations.

Depends only upon prop-types, react and react-dom modules.  
Works on both desktop and mobile.

Online demo [here!](https://sylvaindubus.github.io/react-prismazoom/)

### Zoom features :mag_right:
* Zoom with the mouse-wheel or a two-finger pinch
* Zoom using double-click or double-tap
* Zoom on selected area and center

### Pan features :point_up_2:
* Pan with the mouse pointer or with one finger when zoomed-in
* Intuitive panning depending on available space when zoomed-in
* Adjusts cursor style to indicate in which direction the element can be moved

## Contribution

If you want to contribute, feel free to send a merge request or open a discussion. Currently, I just have time to maintain the package, but not enough to make big changes or add important features.

All contribution would be quite appreciated! ðŸ˜‰

Among changes I would like to apply:
- Migrate to TypeScript
- Transform to a functional component (that could help splitting the code)
- Make motion logic less dependant to React

## Breaking changes on v2

* The package now requires React v16.3 or higher (in order to use react references)
* The zoom feature through gestures or mousewheel got some improvements to react better with all devices. You may need to adjust the `scrollVelocity` property passed to the component in order to keep the same effect.


## Installation

### Install the component
```bash
$ npm i -D react-prismazoom
```
### Install the example project

This project includes a full-featured application example.

First clone the project.

Then, install it:

```
Go to http://localhost:1664.

**Note:** sources of this example can be found in `example/src`.

### Run unit tests

You can either run all tests at once:
```bash

```

Or run tests each time a change on source files occured:
```bash
